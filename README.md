# Virtualization-Platform
Capstone Project for Informations Systems and Cybersecurity

### Abstract
This project aims to develop a comprehensive virtualization management platform optimized for efficient operation on legacy hardware. Building upon Linux foundations, the platform will provide management capabilities for both virtual machines and containers, with automated resource optimization for older hardware.

The development methodology centers around modular architecture principles, incorporating:
- Hardware profiling and optimization engine
- Multi-distribution support framework
- VM management interface
- Alert and notification system
- Automated deployment templates

Key technological components include:
- Java-based backend services
- API framework
- Database-driven state management
- Multi-channel alert system (SMS, email, etc.)
- Resource optimization algorithms

The platform will deliver four predefined deployment profiles: bare-metal minimal, balanced standard, high-performance, and custom configurations. These profiles will automatically adjust resource allocation parameters based on detected hardware capabilities, ensuring optimal performance.

Final deliverables will include:
- Complete source code repository
- Deployment scripts and documentation
- Monitoring and alert system implementation
- Hardware optimization toolkit
- Management interface
- Integration APIs
